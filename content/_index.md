    column_one: >-
      I'm a Dunedin-based web developer with nearly three years of experience in
      crafting high-performance, SEO-optimized websites. I hold a Bachelor of
      Science from Otago University, where I majored in Computer Science and
      minored in Information Science. My focus is on delivering clean,
      accessible code and building editor-friendly sites that prioritize
      seamless user experiences. With a strong background in frontend
      development, I bring designs to life with responsive, functional solutions
      while continuously improving workflows to create efficient, reliable
      projects.
