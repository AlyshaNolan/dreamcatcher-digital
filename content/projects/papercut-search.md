The brief for this project was to create a modern search interface for the PaperCut website using Algolia.

Opting for Algolia's custom API added complexity but provided a more flexible and powerful solution. I served as the lead developer throughout, managing each stage from index creation to the final search interface.

Key steps included:

1. Index Creation in Hugo: Developed a custom output format to generate the Algolia index.
2. Efficient Data Synchronization with Algolia: Streamlined updates by sending only changes (additions, updates, deletions) to improve performance.
3. Interface Development from Figma: Built an intuitive search interface following detailed design specifications.
4. Dynamic Search Results with JavaScript: Integrated Algoliaâ€™s API to dynamically populate search results.
