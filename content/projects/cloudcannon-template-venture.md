As part of a collaborative team project, I contributed to building a polished marketing website template in Eleventy, based on a Figma design.

Our process involved thoughtful discussions to ensure the templateâ€™s flexibility and quality. Each change was thoroughly reviewed by two team members, resulting in a highly refined final product.

Some of the key features I worked on include:

- Flexible Two-Column Component: A customizable left-right layout with reorder capability.

- Configurable SEO Settings: Built-in options for enhancing search visibility.

- Image Gallery Component: A gallery to display images relevant to the users business.

- Embed Component: Easy embedding of external content like Google Docs and Hubspot forms.

- Custom Form Builder: Comprehensive form solution with multiple input types and robust validation.
