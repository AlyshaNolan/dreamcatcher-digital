One of my early projects involved converting a ThemeFisher template to Hugo, fully optimized for use in CloudCannon.

Key features of the template include:

- Dynamic Contact Form and Components: Interactive, user-friendly features that improve engagement.

- Blog with Pagination and Category Pages: Organizes content for seamless browsing and improved user experience.

- Configurable Navigation and Footer: Easily adjustable to meet changing content needs.

- CloudCannon Optimization: Structured for smooth, editor-friendly content management.

- Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Ready: Built with configurable SEO settings for better visibility.

- Pagefind-Powered Search: Enables fast, on-site search functionality.
